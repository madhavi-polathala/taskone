            <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
            <br>
            <h6>Effective June 1,2021</h6>
            <p>Welcome to TalentDrop. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at <strong>support@talentdrop.com.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and <b>TALENTDROP, INC.</b>(“TalentDrop,” “we” and “us”). Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the <strong>Privacy Policy.</strong><b> Your use of or participation in certain Services may also be subject to additional policies, rules and/or conditions (“Additional Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference, and you understand and agree that by using or participating in any such Services, you agree to also comply with these Additional Terms.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Please read these Terms carefully.</b> They cover important information about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, limitations of liability, a class action waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. <b>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</b>EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Will these Terms ever change?</h4>
            <P>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at <strong>talentdrop.com</strong>, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.
                <br>  <br>
                If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
                <br><br>
                Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
            </P>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>What about my privacy?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>TalentDrop takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current TalentDrop Privacy Policy, please <a href="">click here.</a>  
                <br>
                Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act<br>
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 16 years of age; if you are a child under 16 years of age, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="">support@talentdrop.com.</a>
            </p>
            <h4>What are the basics of using Talentdrop?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and user name (“TalentDrop User ID”), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your contact information. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your TalentDrop User ID a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person's name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. If you sign up for an account or make a referral without one, you may receive periodic email notifications and newsletters from Talentdrop. You may opt-out at a later time by contacting support or unsubscribing via the emails (with an "Unsubscribe" link or with a reply).
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or features of the Services by using your account credentials from other services (each, a “Third Party Account”), such as those offered by Google. By using the Services through a Third Party Account, you permit us to access certain information from such account for use by the Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information is accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your privacy settings on your Third Party Account.
            <br><br>
            You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization’s or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).
            <br><br>
            You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party. You will comply with all laws that apply to you, your use of the Services, and your actions and omissions that relate to the Services (for example, Employers must comply with all laws that relate to the Employer Services (as defined below)). If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.
                <br><br>
                You will not share your TalentDrop User ID, account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your TalentDrop User ID, account, password and any other access tools or credentials. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your TalentDrop User ID and account.
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <h4>Connecting Employers and Candidates</h4>
           <p>TalentDrop connects those looking to fill positions at their company (“Employers”) and those looking for job opportunities (“Candidates”) or those looking to refer a Candidate (“Referrer”). When we use the word “you” in these Terms, it refers to any user, regardless of whether he or she is an Employer, Candidate, or Referrer, while if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category of user.
            <br><br>
            TalentDrop uses reasonable efforts to vet each potential Employer, however, before applying to a job posting from any Employer, Candidates and Referrers are responsible for making their own determinations that the Employer is suitable. TalentDrop is only responsible for connecting Employers and Candidates, and can’t and won’t be responsible for making sure that either the Employer is a suitable match for the Candidate or that the Candidate is suitable for Employer’s particular job posting. TalentDrop similarly can’t and won’t be responsible for ensuring that information (including credentials) a Candidate or Employer provides about himself or herself or Employer’s company or that a Referrer provides about a Candidate is accurate or up-to-date. We don’t control the actions of any Candidate, Referrer or Employer.
            <br><br>
            You hereby acknowledge that TalentDrop does not supervise, direct, control or monitor the job postings listed by Employers or the applications submitted by Candidates or Referrers and expressly disclaims any responsibility and liability for the foregoing.
           </p>

           <h4>Are there restrictions in how I can use the Services?</h4>

           <br>
           <br>
           <h4>Are there any terms specific to me as an Employer?</h4>
           <p>No Employer may collect any information from or relating to Candidates (“Candidate Information”), via the Services, or otherwise, beyond what is necessary for the Candidate to apply for a job. Employers also must not use any Candidate Information beyond what is necessary to evaluate whether such Candidate is suitable for a job at Employer. In the event Employer does not hire Candidate, Employer must properly destroy all Candidate Information from or relating to such Candidate and make no further use of it whatsoever. Employers must collect, use, maintain, and transmit all Candidate Information in compliance with all applicable laws.</p>
           <br><br>
           <h4>Are there any terms specific to me as a Referrer?</h4>
            <p>You hereby represent and warrant that you have received explicit consent from each Candidate to share any information relating to such Candidate, including without limitation, such Candidate’s name, contact information (email address, home address, phone number), resume, job title and job history, with TalentDrop and/or with any Employer made available from the Services</p>        
             <br><br>

Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our <a href="">Privacy Policy.</a> to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.
                <br><br>
                By submitting User Submissions through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant TalentDrop a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, edit, modify, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User Submissions in connection with this site, the Services and our (and our successors' and assigns') businesses, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of this site or the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and feeds), and including after your termination of your account or the Services.

If you share information from the Services with others through your Third Party Accounts, such as your social networks, you authorize TalentDrop to share that information with the applicable Third Party Account provider. Please review the policies of any Third Party Account providers you share information with or through for additional information about how they may use your information.

             </p>
             <br><br>
             <h4>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</h4>
             <br>
             <p>In accordance with the DMCA, we've adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders. </p>
             <br><br>
             <h4>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements.</h4>
             <br>
             <p>If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to TalentDrop's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):</p>
                <br>
                <p>1.A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</p>
                <p> 2.of works or materials being infringed;</p>
                <p>  3.Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Company is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</p>
                <p>4.Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address.</p>
                <p>5.A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
                <p>6.A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
           <h4>Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent.</h4>
           <p>Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:</p>
           <br>
           <ul>
            <li>remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>
            <li>notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and</li>
            <li>terminate such content provider's access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.</h4>
        <br>
        <p>If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;</li>
            <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
            <li>A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and</li>       
            <li>Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
            
        </ol>
        <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, the Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company's discretion.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Please contact TalentDrop's Designated Agent at: <a href="">support@talentdrop.com.</a></p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>Will Talentdrop ever change the Services?</h4>
        <br>
        <p>We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Do the Services cost anything?</h4>
        <p>The Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services. If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.        </p>

        <h6>Paid Services</h6>
        <p>Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Please see our<a href="">Paid Services Page </a>for a description of the current Paid Services. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.</p>
        <h6>Billing</h6>
        <p>We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Currently, we use Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor. You can access Stripe’s Terms of Service at <a href="">https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal</a>and their Privacy Policy at<a href=""> https://stripe.com/us/privacy.</a>We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>
        <h6>Payment Method</h6>
        <p>The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>
